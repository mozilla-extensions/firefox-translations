/**
 * This class represents an item for translation. It's basically our
 * wrapper class around a node returned by getTranslationNode, with
 * more data and structural information on it.
 *
 * At the end of the translation process, besides the properties below,
 * a TranslationItem will contain two other properties: one called "original"
 * and one called "translation". They are twin objects, one which reflect
 * the structure of that node in its original state, and the other in its
 * translated state.
 *
 * The "original" array is generated in the TranslationDocument.generateTextForItem function,
 * and the "translation" array is generated when the translation results
 * are parsed.
 *
 * They are both arrays, which contain a mix of strings and references to
 * child translation roots. The references in both arrays point to the * same *
 * TranslationItem object, but they might appear in different orders between the
 * "original" and "translation" arrays.
 *
 * An example:
 *
 *  English: <div id="n1">Welcome to <b id="n2">Mozilla's</b> website</div>
 *  Portuguese: <div id="n1">Bem vindo a pagina <b id="n2">da Mozilla</b></div>
 *
 *  TranslationItem n1 = {
 *    id: 1,
 *    original: ["Welcome to", ptr to n2, "website"]
 *    translation: ["Bem vindo a pagina", ptr to n2]
 *  }
 *
 *  TranslationItem n2 = {
 *    id: 2,
 *    original: ["Mozilla's"],
 *    translation: ["da Mozilla"]
 *  }

/**
 * Helper function to swap the text of a TranslationItem
 * between its original and translated states.
 * How it works:
 *
 * The function iterates through the target array (either the `original` or
 * `translation` array from the TranslationItem), while also keeping a pointer
 * to a current position in the child nodes from the actual DOM node that we
 * are modifying. This pointer is moved forward after each item of the array
 * is translated. If, at any given time, the pointer doesn't match the expected
 * node that was supposed to be seen, it means that the original and translated
 * contents have a different ordering, and thus we need to adjust that.
 *
 * A full example of the reordering process, swapping from Original to
 * Translation:
 *
 *    Original (en): <div>I <em>miss</em> <b>you</b></div>
 *
 * Translation (fr): <div><b>Tu</b> me <em>manques</em></div>
 *
 * Step 1:
 *   pointer points to firstChild of the DOM node, textnode "I "
 *   first item in item.translation is [object TranslationItem <b>]
 *
 *   pointer does not match the expected element, <b>. So let's move <b> to the
 *   pointer position.
 *
 *   Current state of the DOM:
 *     <div><b>you</b>I <em>miss</em> </div>
 *
 * Step 2:
 *   pointer moves forward to nextSibling, textnode "I " again.
 *   second item in item.translation is the string " me "
 *
 *   pointer points to a text node, and we were expecting a text node. Match!
 *   just replace the text content.
 *
 *   Current state of the DOM:
 *     <div><b>you</b> me <em>miss</em> </div>
 *
 * Step 3:
 *   pointer moves forward to nextSibling, <em>miss</em>
 *   third item in item.translation is [object TranslationItem <em>]
 *
 *   pointer points to the expected node. Match! Nothing to do.
 *
 * Step 4:
 *   all items in this item.translation were transformed. The remaining
 *   text nodes are cleared to "", and domNode.normalize() removes them.
 *
 *   Current state of the DOM:
 *     <div><b>you</b> me <em>miss</em></div>
 *
 * Further steps:
 *   After that, the function will visit the child items (from the visitStack),
 *   and the text inside the <b> and <em> nodes will be swapped as well,
 *   yielding the final result:
 *
 *     <div><b>Tu</b> me <em>manques</em></div>
 */

      // an error in the server response. For example, if a translation
      // was broken in various chunks, and one of the chunks failed,

      // field.

    // modifying. During most of the process, while the target array is
    // being iterated (in the for loop below), it should walk together with
    // the array and be pointing to the correct node that needs to modified.
    // If it's not pointing to it, that means some sort of node reordering
    // will be necessary to produce the correct translation.
    // Note that text nodes don't need to be reordered, as we can just replace

    // as the reordering algorithm would correctly handle this case. However,
    // this better aligns the resulting translation with the DOM content of the
    // page, avoiding cases that would need to be unecessarily reordered.
    //
    // An example of how this helps:
    //
    // ---- Original: <div>                <b>Hello </b> world.</div>
    //                       ^textnode 1      ^item 1      ^textnode 2
    //
    // - Translation: <div><b>Hallo </b> Welt.</div>
    //
    // Transformation process without this optimization:
    //   1 - start pointer at textnode 1
    //   2 - move item 1 to first position inside the <div>
    //
    //       Node now looks like: <div><b>Hello </b>[         ][ world.]</div>
    //                                         textnode 1^       ^textnode 2
    //
    //   3 - replace textnode 1 with " Welt."
    //   4 - clear remaining text nodes (in this case, textnode 2)
    //
    // Transformation process with this optimization:
    //   1 - start pointer at item 1
    //   2 - item 1 is already in position
    //   3 - replace textnode 2 with " Welt."
    //
    // which completely avoids any node reordering, and requires only one
    // text change instead of two (while also leaving the page closer to
    // its original state).
